Congratulations! Your child has leveled up to Level ${winner.level}! This means that your child has earned and submitted at least 25 PBIS cards! Remember that PBIS cards are awarded by staff to students for following expectations and creating a positive academic and social environment. Earned and submitted cards benefit not just the individual student, but also the TA and school as a whole - so keep encouraging your child to submit their cards as they earn them!

Individual levels are based on a tiered system, with each level requiring a set number of cards which rises every 2 levels. As the number of required cards increases, so does the number of rewards available to students. Click here to view our level up system poster!

Check in with your child to find out what prize they have earned. Be sure to congratulate them on modeling our three habits of work: Respect, Responsibility, and Perseverance!

Thank you for continuing to encourage your child to be a positive member of our falcon community.
